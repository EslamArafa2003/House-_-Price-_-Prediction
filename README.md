I provide an explanation for my code step by step and explain why i used certain techniques or model. This explanation will help others understand my code:

1. Import Libraries:

I start by importing necessary Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

2. Load the Dataset:

I load the housing dataset (kc_house_data.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. Check for Missing Values:

I check for missing values in the dataset using isnull().sum() to ensure the data's completeness.

4. Data Preprocessing:

I select relevant features (X) such as square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, grade, and condition, define the target variable (y) as the house price and standardize (scale) the features using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to make all features have a mean of 0 and standard deviation

5. Split the Data:

I split the data into training (%80) and testing (%20) sets using train_test_split to assess model performance.

6. Model Selection:

I choose a RandomForestRegressor as the predictive model. Random forests are an ensemble method and often provide better predictive accuracy compared to linear regression.

7. Model Training:

I fit the random forest model to the training data to learn the relationships between features and house prices.

8. Predict for a New House:

demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict the price of a new house based on it's features and scale the new house's features to match the scaling used during training.

9. Model Evaluation:

calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

10. Scatter Plot:

create a scatter plot that visually compares actual house prices with predicted prices, helping you see how well the model performs. Points close to the 45-degree line (y = x) are accurate predictions.

11. Histogram of Prediction Errors:

create a histogram that shows the distribution of prediction errors, helping me understand the error distribution and its characteristics.

12. Error Heatmap Scatter Plot:

create a scatter plot with colors representing prediction errors, giving a visual indication of the error magnitude. Darker colors indicate larger errors,using RandomForestRegressor instead of linear regression is to handle non-linear relationships in the data. Random forests can capture complex patterns that linear regression might miss. Additionally, i provided a variety of visualization techniques to help understand the model's performance and the distribution of prediction errors and making the results more interpretable.

13. The model's performance metrics and key results are as follows:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Approximately 69,796,723,760.41.

The MSE quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual house prices. A lower value is better.
R-squared (R2) Score: Approximately 0.5389.

The R2 score indicates the proportion of the variance in house prices explained by the model. A higher value is better. In this case, the model explains about 53.89% of the variance.
Predicted Price for New House: $481,562.50.

The model predicts the price of a new house with specified features. The prediction is based on the trained model.
